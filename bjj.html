        <p>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) has quickly become one of my favorite hobbies. I showed up to a practice run by the BJJ club at USF and immediately became hooked. The sport itself is engaging, educational, and useful. A typical practice will have you teaming up with others to learn and practice techniques. A major benefit of learning BJJ is the utility it brings in a self defense situation. As much fun as the sport is, I get enjoyment out of being active and social as well. The people are equally as enjoyable as the sport, as they keep things fun and challenging. I also appreciate all of the support given by the club officers and volunteers. As a newcomer, the sport was unfamiliar and a bit overwhelming at first, but the support of others allowed me to succeed. I hope to continue enjoying the sport and the people in the future.</p>
