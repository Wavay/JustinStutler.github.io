        <h2>Hi, I'm Justin Stutler</h2>
        <p>I was born in Atlanta, Georgia and grew up in the suburbs until my mom received a career change that brought us to Florida. This abrupt change left us on our own in a new place with no connections but through the power of community and connection with other people, we have not only survived but thrived. I have enjoyed my time of growth and change that Florida has brought to me. I am proud to say I am expecting to graduate USF with a bachelor's degree in information science with a concentration in web development in the spring of 2024. Alongside this achievement has come many new experiences and many new friends. While at USF for the past 2 years, I have enjoyed many school events, classes, and clubs. Some of my favorite experiences from USF include: oil painting class, pottery club, brazilian jiu jitsu club, yoga class, DJ class, Halloween festival, and chess club.

            My studies at USF primarily involved information science, information technology, web development, and data science (See Course List on Academics Page). Prior to USF, my curriculum at KSU primarily involved computer science, computer software, computer hardware, and statistics. This gave me a strong understanding of coding and data, while USFâ€™s curriculum taught me web based coding, information literacy, and writing.

            I have always had an interest in technology even in my youth. I grew up toying with old technologies trying to understand them and get them to work if they did not. My parents always relied on my technological skills to get the wifi working or fix whatever issue was present. I first started learning to code in high school. I was lucky to have a program in my high school that taught us how to code, make software, make games, and animate. My interest in creating video games drove me to learn. When I got to college, I decided to continue my interests but in a more formal manner by studying computer science. I worked an internship that was web development based and was proud to learn so much so quickly. When I transferred to USF, I chose to shift my studies to web development to further my knowledge on the subject. I hope to work in the web development space once again after I graduate.
